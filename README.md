## Work Distribution:

### Part 1
* **xingjie1** and **ywu18** worked on the frontend aspect of the project.
* **kanishk** worked on designing the database (models.py) and the README.
* **drapeza** worked on the connecting the frontend with the database using a REST API.
* **wstix** worked on project setup, helped everyone out in combining their parts, GitHub management, and bugfixing.

## Design Principles:

### 1) Author
#### Keynotes - Database Implications:
* Can login/sign up - Store a unique identifier, personal info and password
* Make, like and comment on posts - store a list of said *posts*
* Upload images/profile pictures - store the image url to refer
* Can be from different host - store the host url

### 2) Friend Request
#### Keynotes - Database Implications:
* Can be one-sided (becomes a follow) - store if x follows y
* Can be two-sided (become a friend if accepted from both sides) - store if the
  x follows y and if y follow x separately and uniquely
* Is unique - store an identifier

### 3) Post
#### Keynotes - Database Implications:
* Is unique - store an identifier
* Can contain multiple content types - provide options for the type of content
* Can contain an image - store the uploaded image **and** the url
* Can contain comments/likes - store a list of comments/authors who have left a like
* Belongs to an author - store the author id

### 4) Comment
#### Keynotes - Database Implications:
* Belongs to an author - store the author id
* Belongs to a post - store the post id
* Is unique - store an identifier

### 5) Like
#### Keynotes - Database Implications:
* Can belong to a comment - store comment id
* Can belong to a post - store the post id
* Is unique but removable - store identifier
