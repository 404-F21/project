    * Note: pyenv is not neccessary to install if python v3.8 is installed
* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/404-F21/project.git`
* `cd project/`
* Establish the module requirements: `pipenv sync`
* Activate the virtual env: `pipenv shell`
* Migrate all the migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
* Navigate to `front_end/`, and run `npm ci` followed by `npm start`
  * If `npm start` fails, run `export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider`

## Design Principles:

### 1) Author
#### Keynotes - Database Implications:
* Can login/sign up - Store a unique identifier, personal info and password
* Make, like and comment on posts - store a list of said *posts*
* Upload images/profile pictures - store the image url to refer
* Can be from different host - store the host url

### 2) Follow
#### Keynotes - Database Implications:
* Can be one-sided (just normal) - store if x follows y
* Can be two-sided (becomes a friend pair if accepted from both sides) - store
  x following y and y following x separately and uniquely
* Is unique - store an identifier
* Friends are implemented through views and serializers rather than models

### 3) Post
#### Keynotes - Database Implications:
* Is unique - store an identifier
* Can contain multiple content types - provide options for the type of content
* Can contain an image - store the uploaded image **and** the url
* Can contain comments/likes - store a list of comments/authors who have left a like
* Belongs to an author - store the author id

### 4) Comment
#### Keynotes - Database Implications:
* Belongs to an author - store the author id
* Belongs to a post - store the post id
* Is unique - store an identifier

### 5) Like
#### Keynotes - Database Implications:
* Can belong to a comment - store comment id
* Can belong to a post - store the post id
* Is unique but removable - store identifier
